# CS1010SA_interviewbot

This repository served to facilitate the interviews of CS1010S/A New Tutors

I'll update this readme later on, but the use of the bot was very specific.

1. sample-env.py hosted all the necessary information such as questions, and configs
2. The project has a dockerfile for ease of deployment
